Description: Calculating rates of climate change or extent of climate change 
        exposure is important for many environmental questions. Working with climate 
        data can be a bit daunting for researchers who are not climatologists and 
        simply want to use climate change as a covariate for another model, however, 
        because it is complex, multifaceted, and the files are typically enormous and 
        difficult to work with. To help make calculating climate change metrics slightly 
        easier for researchers, climetric is an R package that calculates a common 
        set of climate and weather data to characterize rates of climate change and 
        departures from baseline conditions using univariate or multivariate approaches.
